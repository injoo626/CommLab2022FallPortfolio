        <Br> First days are always a odd mixture of <strong>anxiety and excitement</strong>.<br> <br>

        first week of univertiy. <br> <br> The website features the film and the <strong> 30 Minute Film Festival </strong>which invites videographers 
        around the world to share their work produced in thirty minutes. </p>

        "Normalcy Test" twists this belief that one common norm exists. The project initially invites users to test their 
        normalcy by answering how they would behave in the given situations. In the end, however, the website reminds that 
        <span style = "color: #f7ecde; background-color: #e7ad43;"> every individual is unique</span> and there is no need to struggle to fit in.</p>

        The audience never gets to know what actually happened in the laundry room; they only have to guess 
        the story based on the two completely different point of views. Did Chad really steal Mariette's underwear? 
        Or is Mariette accusing an innocent person? </p>
